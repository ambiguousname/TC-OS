# ATTENTION!

TC-OS is now deprecated because well, it's something that I made that was stupid.

But you can still try it out, if you want.

# TC-OS
TC-OS is a program that is something you should never ever use. Really. It's designed to be crappy. The C in TC-OS stands for Crappy. Seriously, stay away from this.

However, if you really want to use TC-OS, we have to cover a couple of things:

# What is TC-OS?
TC-OS is a program that allows you to do tasks your everyday computer would do. So I'm not sure why exactly you'd be here. You have a computer right? I mean, you wouldn't be able to view what I'm typing right now. So, I mean... why are you still here? Alright, fine. Here you go:

# Starting TC-OS

1. Download the file as a zip file. The zip file is usually found under the releases page.
2. Extract the files into a new folder.
3. Open the TC-OS UI Home.html file. Then you'll get a tutorial. Type in commands exactly as spelled, and remember: it's case sensitive. So don't use capital letters when typing in commands.
4. If there are any problems, put it down as an issue in the issues section of the TC-OS github.
